# Install

```bash
pip install simple-scenario
```

# Use

`simple-scenario` offers a rich python API and a basic CLI for test scenario generation.

## Python API

The python API supports various ways of generating and interacting with test scenarios.

Please conduct the [tutorials/A_01_getting_started.ipynb](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario/blob/main/tutorials/A_01_getting_started.ipynb) to learn about the basic usage of `simple-scenario`.

Please find more in-depth examples in the [test/](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario/tree/main/test) folder (E.g., [test/test_scenario.py](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario/blob/main/test/test_scenario.py) shows which input formats can be used).

> :bulb: *Have a look at the [Dev](#dev) section of this readme to find out how to setup the project and run the tutorial notebooks and tests.*

## CLI

The CLI supports generating a set of

* an OpenSCENARIO (`.xosc`)
* and an OpenDRIVE (`.xodr`) file

for a given `simple-scenario` config file (`.json`) through the following command

```bash
simple-scenario create demo/cutout_example.json
```

# Extras

## commonroad-extra

> :warning: *Needs python version 3.8*

```bash
pip install simple-scenario[commonroad]
```

Enables advanced features like feasibility checking of the scenario (powered by the [CommonRoad Drivability Checker](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/drivability-checker)) and exporting the scenario to the [CommonRoad](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/) (CR) format.

Please conduct the [tutorials/B_01_commonroad_extra.ipynb](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario/blob/main/tutorials/B_01_commonroad_extra.ipynb) for more details.

## lxd-extra

```bash
pip install simple-scenario[lxd]
```

Enables reading [leveLXData](https://levelxdata.com/) datasets through [lxd-io](https://github.com/lenvt/lxd-io).

> :warning: *Currently only the [highD dataset](https://highd-dataset.com) is supported*

Please conduct the [tutorials/C_01_lxd_extra.ipynb](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario/blob/main/tutorials/C_01_lxd_extra.ipynb) for more details.

# Dev

To develop `simple-scenario`, you must first clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone git@gitlab.ika.rwth-aachen.de:fb-fi/scenarios/simple-scenario.git
$ cd simple-scenario
```

It is recommended to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for package management. If you do not want to use `uv`, please consult the [Without uv](#without-uv) section.

## With uv

Install requirements with

```bash
$ uv sync
```

To run a script, use

```bash
$ uv run /path/to/script.py
```

or directly use the python interpreter from the `.venv` folder in e.g. VSCode.

To run the tests, install the dev requirements with

```bash
$ uv sync --dev
```

and run the tests

```bash
$ uv run pytest
```

To run the notebooks in the [tutorials/](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario/tree/main/tutorials) folder in VSCode, select the `.venv`'s as the kernel (see [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#using-jupyter-from-vs-code) for more info).

## Without uv

Install the project editable

```bash
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

To run the tests, first install pytest

```bash
$ python -m pip install pytest
```

and run

```bash
$ pytest
```
